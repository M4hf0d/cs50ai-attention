# Masked Word Prediction using BERT

## Overview

This project involves creating an AI to predict a masked word in a text sequence using the BERT language model. The project is divided into two main parts:
1. Implementing a program to predict masked words using BERT.
2. Analyzing the attention diagrams generated by the model to understand what BERT's attention heads focus on.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: The latest version of Python you should use is Python 3.12.
- **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to Run

To run the program, use the following command:

```sh
$ python mask.py
```
### Usage
```py
Text: We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].

We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small field.
We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small clearing.
